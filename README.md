# Pear

A boilerplate for static site projects. Personally, I often use this for quick HTML prototyping.

See it at http://eatapear.com.

Pear is focused on:

- 100% responsive design
- Performance
- Maintainability
- Architecture/workflow

## What's Included

- HTML boilerplate with a simple pattern library (demonstrated on the website).
- Base Sass styles
- Icon font family
- Advanced Gulp setup for a local server, CSS compliation & minification, etc

## Getting Started
There's a few options:

- Download directly from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jrdnbwmn/pear).
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/jrdnbwmn/pear.git`.
- Install with [Bower](http://bower.io/): `bower install pear`.

Run `npm install` and then `gulp` to get BrowserSync going along with all the Gulp tasks.
